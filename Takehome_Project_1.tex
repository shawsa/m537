Consider an insulated rod with end-points kept at constant temperatures $\alpha$ and $\beta$, diffusivity $D$, and internal source $q(x)$. Let $f(x)$, with $0<x<1$, be the initial distribution of the temperature in the rod. The temperature $u(x,t)$ in the rod satisfies the equations:
\begin{equation}
 \left \{
	\begin{aligned}
		\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}(x,t) & = D \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}(x,t) + q(x), && 0 <x <1, & 0&<t \\
		u(0,t) & = \alpha, \ \  u(1,t) = \beta, && & 0 & < t \\
		u(x,0) & = f(x), && 0  < x < 1
	\end{aligned} 
\right .
\end{equation}
Suppose
\begin{align*}
	f(x) & = (\alpha - x)(x- \beta) \\
	 q(x) & = \pi^2\sin(\pi x) \\
	\alpha & = 1, \beta = -3, D=1
\end{align*}

\problem{1.} Determine the equilibrium solution. \bigbreak

The equilibrium solution is the solution for which the temperature at teach point is constant with respect to time. Mathematically we represent this by saying $\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = 0$. Incorporating this we get
\begin{align*}
0 & = D \frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}(x) + q(x) \\
\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}(x) & = -\frac{1}{D}q(x) \\
& = -\pi^2 \sin(\pi x) \\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}(x) & = \pi \cos(\pi x) \\
u_\infty
\end{align*}
